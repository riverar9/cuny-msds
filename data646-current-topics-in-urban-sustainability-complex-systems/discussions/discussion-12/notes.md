### Intro
- Brings up the inequality of enviormental "goods" and "bads"
- The lower income groups are typically fighting the enviornment to remove "bads" like pollution, brownzones, etc
- The higher income groups are fighting for more "goods" like bike lanes, and etc.
- The creation or restoration of an in situ environmental good will increase environmental inequality, as the amenity drives up property values, physically displaces those at the lower end of the stratification pyramid, and attracts new residents at the higher end.
- Prospect Park is assessed. It was targetd for remediation at the beginning of 1980 and didn't have any policy intervention on the distribution of the "good"
    - This sounds like:
        1. The city was improved using city funds
        2. The city didn't care who moved in
        3. The rich moved in
        4. The improvement (economic, social, enviromental, etc) benfit of the park was held only for the rich

### Race and Class residential Inequality
- Race is a predictor as to where enviromentally hazardous facilities will be located
- Basically, that redlining, inaccessible loans (to minorities), segregation, white flight, etc created pockets where minorities are allowed to live which generated less opportunity (education, network) and added to a cycle. The groups lack of representation made it so enviromental groups focused on "white" neighborhoods and pushed any negative externalities to the poorer residencies.
- "Markets, left to function on their own without state intervention, will normally distribute goods and services on the basis of wealth"
- Capitalist markets typically result in residences to be divided by class.
- When the property values increase, a group of people are priced out due to increasing valuation of real estate as "gentrification" begins.
- Markets typically reallocate access to an improved enviornmental amenity further away from the existing populace/poor for the rich.
- **This system, unchecked, is positively feeding. As more places are degraded, the prices of that area drops pushing out the rich and attracting more poor. As places are improved, prices increase pushing out the poor and attracting the rich**

### THE SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY OF POWER
- "In capitalist [oligarchical] societies, wealth is a primary component of power."
- Less money and less ability to resist taking the "bads" and fight for getting the "goods"

### RACE, CLASS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN BROOKLYN
- In the 1970s, after good paying manufacturing jobs left, brooklyn was categorized as in decline. This meant that there was white flight and the people who stayed were typically of color. Unemployment, aid dependence, and investment from the city dropped. This changed after 1990 with the building of (jay street)metrotech and 9/11 which had the rich "whites" come over from manhattan. They were able to purchase housing for cheap, piggybacking on the "decline" status.
- Fucking Cochoran steered minorities away from good housing in brooklyn to maintain white neighborhoods. The National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA) found consistentaly that they failed fair housing initatives.

### PROSPECT PARK
- The park was a grand vision in the 1850s to build wealth through property values, trying to emulate central park. But in the 1950s, it was delapedated. Improvement began in the 1980s and, when it completed it was something that was of high value and now desirable. The same Cochran group said it was "one of the most desirable place in the US".
