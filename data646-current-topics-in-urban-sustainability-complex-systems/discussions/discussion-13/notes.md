# Pluye, et. al Making public health programs last: conceptualizing sustainability

This article re-conceptualizes public health program sustainability by addressing shortcomings in how it's traditionally understood in terms of social structures and timing.

### Core Problem:
* Existing models narrowly focus on **organizational routines** for sustainability and view sustainability as a **final stage** after implementation, which is insufficient.

### Proposed Re-conceptualization:

1.  **Broader Social Structures:**
    * **Routines:** Program activities becoming stable, regular parts of an organization (defined by memory, adaptation, values, rules) – the **primary process of routinization**.
    * **Standards:** Programs aligning with or being constrained by higher-level **institutional standards** (e.g., public policies, legal frameworks) – a **secondary process of standardization**, leading to more robust sustainability.

2.  **Revised Timing:**
    * Sustainability efforts are **concomitant (simultaneous) with implementation**, not just a follow-up phase. It must be considered from the program's outset.

### Key Outcomes & Concepts:

* **Three Degrees of Sustainability:**
    1.  **Weak:** Activities continue but are not routinized or standardized.
    2.  **Medium:** Activities are routinized in an organization but not standardized.
    3.  **High:** Activities are routinized and standardized (aligned with institutional standards).
* **Shift from 'Stage' Model:** Rejects a linear progression (plan -> implement -> evaluate -> sustain) in favor of a model where these processes are ongoing and interconnected.

### Main Implication:
* To make public health programs last, practitioners and policymakers must proactively build sustainability by embedding programs into **organizational routines** and, for greater durability, aligning them with **broader institutional standards**, starting from the earliest phases of program development and throughout implementation.

# Frumkin & McMichael - Climate Change: The Public Health Response

This article argues for a comprehensive public health approach to address the substantial and unprecedented health impacts of climate change, utilizing the framework of the 10 Essential Public Health Services.

### Core Problem & Context:
* **Scientific Consensus:** Global climate is changing (rising temperatures, melting ice/snow, rising sea levels, increased climate variability).
* **Health Impacts:** These changes are expected to significantly affect human health, including:
    * Injuries/fatalities from severe weather and heatwaves.
    * Infectious diseases (vector-borne, waterborne, foodborne).
    * Allergic, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases.
    * Nutritional shortages.
    * Mental health consequences, population displacement, and conflict (indirect).
* **Urgency:** The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated over 150,000 excess deaths per year globally from climate change by 2000.

### Proposed Public Health Response:

* A proactive approach based on established public health principles:
    * **Prevention:**
        * Primary (mitigation): Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mainly non-health sectors).
        * Secondary/Tertiary (adaptation): Anticipating, preparing for, and reducing health burdens (core to public health/medical practice).
    * **Public Health Preparedness:** Consistent with responses to terrorism, pandemics, and natural disasters.
    * **Precautionary Principle:** Taking action even without full scientific certainty on all cause-effect links.
    * **Risk Management:** Systematically identifying and reducing health risks.
    * **Co-benefits:** Recognizing that climate action often yields other health benefits (e.g., improved air quality, increased physical activity).
    * **Economic Considerations:** Timely action is more cost-effective than procrastination.
    * **Ethical Imperatives:** Grounded in medical and public health ethics (beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice, utilitarianism, liberalism, communitarianism).

### Framework for Action: The 10 Essential Public Health Services

The article details how each of the 10 Essential Public Health Services can be applied to climate change:

1.  **Monitor Health Status:** Track climate-related diseases, risks, and vulnerabilities.
2.  **Diagnose & Investigate:** Enhance capacity to identify and explain health problems linked to climate change, including attribution.
3.  **Inform, Educate & Empower:** Communicate risks and risk-reduction strategies effectively to the public and policymakers.
4.  **Mobilize Community Partnerships:** Collaborate with diverse sectors (government, academia, private, NGOs, city planners, faith communities) for integrated solutions.
5.  **Develop Policies & Plans:** Support mitigation policies and develop adaptation plans (e.g., heatwave preparedness, "climate-proof" infrastructure, greening the health sector).
6.  **Enforce Laws & Regulations:** Provide science-based input for relevant environmental, transportation, and energy laws.
7.  **Link to Health Services & Ensure Care:** Strengthen emergency medical systems, disaster response, and mental health services.
8.  **Ensure Competent Workforce:** Train health professionals to recognize, manage, and research climate-related health threats.
9.  **Evaluate Services:** Assess the effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of climate-related health interventions.
10. **Research:** Investigate health effects, forecast impacts, and develop/test risk reduction strategies.

### Key Considerations for Action:

* **Regional Variation:** Health effects and necessary responses will differ geographically.
* **Health Disparities:** Climate change will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations; responses must address these inequities.
* **Complexity:** Addressing climate change requires systems thinking and multidisciplinary approaches.

### Conclusion:
An effective public health response to climate change is essential. While the challenge is unprecedented in scope and complexity, established public health frameworks, particularly the Essential Services, offer a robust structure for action.

# Twiss et. al Community Gardens: Lessons Learned From California Healthy Cities and Communities

his field action report highlights the significant public health and community benefits of community gardens, drawing lessons from initiatives supported by California Healthy Cities and Communities (CHCC).

### Core Argument & Significance:
* Community gardens are exceptionally effective in addressing a range of public health issues, enhancing nutrition and physical activity, improving food access (especially for populations with health disparities), and building community capacity.
* They serve as tangible demonstrations of public health efforts and can foster neighborhood ownership, civic pride, and new alliances.

### CHCC Experience & Approach:
* CHCC funded and provided technical assistance to several California cities to develop community gardens, often to improve community nutrition, physical activity, or food security.
* Each city's approach was unique, building on local leadership and resources.

### Key Elements for Successful Community Gardens:
* **Commitment of local leadership and staffing:** Including city council support and allocation of financial/in-kind resources (e.g., land purchase, ongoing staffing).
* **Involvement of volunteers and community partners:** Diverse participation from residents, schools, health departments, universities, businesses, and civic associations.
* **Availability of skill-building opportunities for participants:** Workshops and experiential learning in gardening, leadership, community organizing, and program planning.

### Reported Results & Outcomes:
* **Improved Health Behaviors:**
    * West Hollywood: Participants (n=338) increased physical activity (6% increase) and fruit/vegetable consumption (10% increase, from 3.44 to 3.78 servings/day).
    * San Bernardino: Students gardening at home after a school program increased by 20% (from 62 to 75).
* **Policy Changes:**
    * Berkeley: Passed the Berkeley Food and Nutrition Policy supporting small-scale sustainable agriculture.
    * Escondido: Approved an "Adopt-A-Lot" policy for interim use of vacant land for gardens and a no-cost water policy for gardens on city property.
* **Community Building:** Strengthened community skills and elevated public consciousness about public health.
* **Resource Development:** Creation of culturally appropriate educational materials (cookbooks, newsletters).

### Common Lessons Learned:
* Importance of ongoing training, mentoring, and leadership development.
* Building on successful community-based programs through partnerships.
* Raising public awareness of the benefits of community gardens.
* Experiential work often leading to positive changes in municipal codes and policies.

### Looking Ahead (Challenges & Opportunities):
* **Educating Stakeholders:** Ongoing communication about benefits is needed to maintain momentum despite leadership changes.
* **Integrating Gardens into Development:** Incorporating gardens into new and existing structures (schools, parks) despite land shortages.
* **Supporting Research:** A need for more data and user-friendly evaluation tools to measure the impacts of community gardens (physical benefits, community connectedness) to make a stronger case for resources.
* **Investing for the Long Term:** Sustained policymaking, funding, staffing, and in-kind resources are crucial for planning, implementation, and evaluation.

# Garcia, Urban green space, public health, and environmental justice: The challenge of making cities ‘just green enough’

This paper reviews the critical role of urban green spaces (parks, gardens, green roofs, etc.) in promoting public health and providing ecosystem services, while also highlighting the environmental justice challenges related to their distribution and the paradoxical effects of urban greening efforts.

### Core Arguments & Findings:

* **Public Health Benefits:** Urban green space promotes physical activity, psychological well-being (reducing stress, enhancing mood), and overall public health. Lack of access is linked to issues like obesity and reduced mental health.
* **Environmental Injustice:** Access to urban green space is often inequitably distributed, disproportionately benefiting more affluent and predominantly White communities. Many minority and low-income communities lack adequate access, constituting an environmental justice issue.
    * In the US, people of color and low-income earners often have less access to safe, well-maintained green spaces.
* **Urban Greening Strategies:**
    * US cities implement strategies like greening remnant land and reusing obsolete infrastructure to increase green space in park-poor areas.
    * Chinese cities (e.g., Hangzhou) also employ innovative greening, such as demolishing factories for parks and retrofitting green space along canals and transport lines, despite different land control systems. Hangzhou aims for 15 m² of green space per capita, but distribution and suitability for active recreation remain concerns.
* **The Urban Green Space Paradox (Eco-gentrification):**
    * Creating new green space to address environmental justice can make neighborhoods more attractive and healthier, but this can also increase housing costs and property values.
    * This can lead to **gentrification** (termed "ecological," "green," or "eco-gentrification"), displacing the very residents the greening was intended to benefit. Examples include New York's High Line and Seoul's Cheonggyecheon Waterway.
* **The Challenge: 'Just Green Enough':**
    * The primary challenge is to develop urban green space strategies that provide public health and ecological benefits without causing gentrification and displacement.
    * This requires moving beyond market-driven or purely ecological restoration approaches to ones explicitly shaped by community needs and concerns.

### Proposed Solutions & Future Directions:

* **'Just Green Enough' Strategies:**
    * Design green space projects explicitly shaped by community concerns, needs, and desires, potentially allowing for continued industrial uses or focusing on local needs like urban agriculture.
    * Focus on small-scale, scattered-site interventions rather than grand projects that concentrate resources and may trigger gentrification.
    * Support these strategies with anti-gentrification policies (e.g., affordable housing, rent stabilization, protections for local businesses).
* **Community Involvement:** Requires community activism and collaboration between local government, planners, designers, ecologists, and residents to contest powerful real estate interests and mainstream environmental advocacy.
* **Integrative Policies:** Urban green space projects need policies that explicitly protect social *and* ecological sustainability.

### Conclusion:
Urban planners, designers, and ecologists must articulate and implement urban green space strategies that advance public health, environmental equity, and social justice, avoiding the paradoxical outcomes of green gentrification by aiming to make cities ‘just green enough’.
