Hello everyone!

This week’s readings were a great reminder of how messy decision-making gets when you have a bunch of stakeholders with different priorities. Here’s what stood out to me:

Lélé and Norgaard’s piece on interdisciplinary collaboration hit home. They pointed out how hard it can be for people from different fields to work together, especially when they don’t understand each other’s frameworks or assumptions. I loved their idea of re-labeling experts based on what they’re not experts in—like calling someone an “unnatural scientist” if they’re not in natural sciences. It’s a funny way to highlight that no one knows everything, and we all have blind spots. As someone closer to the “unsocial sciences,” I’ve had to work through this gap and have seen it a lot. It’s a real barrier to solving problems effectively.

Innes and Booher argued that too many rules and too much complexity can hold cities back. Specifically with California, they think we should loosen up and let things get a little chaotic to find better solutions. I’m not convinced. Their example of a ship navigating without sensors felt too optimistic, and their carpooling example in San Francisco seemed like a weak solution to traffic congestion. Our policies and rules exist for a reason. That being said, I did find that their 3 ideas to move forward to make systems "more informed, responsive and transformative" sounded reasonable to me and that using collaborative consensus building seems like an idea that we would benefit from.

Costanza, Mitsch, and Day Jr. gave a sobering example of environmental mismanagement with Hurricane Katrina. The erosion of wetlands, caused by engineering the Mississippi River Delta for trade, made the disaster much worse. They suggest using a framework that considers built, human, social, and natural capital, which makes a lot of sense. It’s wild to think that the $100 billion in repairs could’ve been avoided with better planning (likely not entirely but a significant reduction is still an improvement). This shows why we need a wide range of experts at the table—otherwise, we’re setting ourselves up for more disasters.

Finally, Buntz’s article on smart cities was interesting. It seemed that you were able to get on the list with essentially just smart parking which felt like a low bar, but bigger ideas like congestion pricing in London and Singapore, or Oslo's plan to ban private cars were things that gave hope. Oslo’s approach is especially bold and shows how cities can rethink infrastructure to be more sustainable and I was happy to find out that they've actually implemented the ban in 2019! It would be pretty unique to see a downtown environment completely devoid of private cars!

In my viewpoint from the listed 4 readings we went over, they really emphasize how incredibly challenging and important it is that we build our environments right. The only way we can do so, is by working together and building systems which reinforce the learnings we've experienced and allows us to make our built environments more sustainable and equitable. Going back to how New Orleans fared in the face of hurricane Katrina and how a portion of it could have been naturally avoided, we seemingly have frequent wake-up calls to take action. This brings up the idea of the de-growth movement which I remember Naomi and Dan bringing up during last week's discussion. At the minimum, we must devise ways to include the costs and benefits to other groups rather than solely our economic output!

Thank you for reading my memo/rant this week!
