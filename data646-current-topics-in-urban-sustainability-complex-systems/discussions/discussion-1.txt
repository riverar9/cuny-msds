Hi everyone! I’ve just finished the readings and I’ve really enjoyed them! Many of what they’ve brought up has been something that my intuition has been picking up on. From the reading, I agree that there is an overemphasis on technology as a solution for urban sustainability that is, in my view, a flawed approach. While technology can address some low-hanging fruit—like optimizing energy use or streamlining public transit—it’s not a silver bullet for the complex, emergent nature of cities. Cities are chaotic, living systems shaped by the millions of individuals who inhabit them. This inherent complexity means that top-down, tech-driven solutions often fail to account for the human element. A great example of this is Masdar City, which was designed to be a cutting-edge, eco-friendly utopia but ended up as a resource-intensive ghost town. It’s a cautionary tale about how focusing too much on technological innovation can lead to solutions that look great on paper but fail in practice. This reminds me of the current AI hype cycle, where every problem seems to have a shiny new AI-powered fix, even though the underlying issues—like inequality, housing, and transportation—are as old as cities themselves. We can’t just slap “smart city” labels on everything and expect real change.

That’s why I think the three pillars of sustainability—social, economic, and environmental (that were covered in the first chapter of the Theis and Tonkin text)—are a much better framework for addressing urban challenges. Cities have existed for millennia, and their long term viability has always depended on balancing these three factors. Technology can play a role, but it’s not the starting point. For example, let’s talk about car-centric design, which is a huge problem in the U.S. I live in NYC, and even here—where less than 25% of households own a car—36% of Manhattan’s land area (including residential land) is dedicated to streets (according to Vanderbilt University). This isn’t just inefficient; it’s a failure to prioritize the needs of the majority who walk, bike, or use public transit. And it’s not just NYC—nearly every city I’ve visited in the U.S. is designed around cars, not people. This kind of design isn’t just bad for the environment; it’s bad for social and economic sustainability, too. Streets clogged with cars mean more pollution, less space for housing or businesses, and fewer opportunities for community interaction.

Ultimately, urban sustainability requires long-term thinking and a focus on real-life solutions, not just the latest tech fads. We’re designing for centuries, not just for the next decade, so we need to be skeptical of solutions that rely on untested or overly complex technologies. Instead, we should focus on what’s worked for cities throughout history: creating spaces that prioritize people, foster community, and adapt to changing needs. Technology can be a tool, but it can’t be the goal.

Thank you for reading my memo/rant!
