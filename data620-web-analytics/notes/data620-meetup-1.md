    - Senior software engineer at some hedge fund
    - team lead for risk management
    - he's always worked in finance
- Class has two components
    - (50%) Social network analytics (also just network analysis)
        - This is focused as it's not a "sexy" topic
        - good for analyzing relationships across a networks
    - (50%) natural language processing

        4. this is heavily documented

- Meetups
    - optional
    - during class, we'll present our analysis and have an opportunity to get 

- assignments (20%)
    - For assignments, he wants us to find our own datasets
        - this is cuz "we'll be more motivated with a dataset we like"
    - Airports are good for network analysis
        - airports are nodes and destinations are edges(?)
    - due dates aren't enforced. The assignments are due the MOMENT before the meetup.
    - he is very lenient and is willing to take late work for full credit
    - but he finds that students who fall into this don't do well
    - **Always use Jupyter or Colab notebooks.**
        - Colab notebooks are easier
    - **Submit a link to the notebook MUST BE ON GITHUB**
        - he spent a lot of time talking about the last 2 points
    - **PYTHON ONLY**
    - First assignment is individual, and no presentation is necessary
    - **demonstrate and communicate the analysis, use the techniques covered in the book**
        - We don't need to be successful in getting the answer, but we must use the tools to try and have a discussion

    - there are 3 total projects

- Final Project (25%)
    - The final project has the highest point value

        - He grades on the sunday after the "due date"
    - These posts are not complicated

- He prefers us to work in teams
    - 2 or 3 people, 4 is disliked but possible
    - First assignment is individually done

- Professor will heavily use announcements

- email the professor through gmail only
    - cuban.quant@gmail.com 

- some of the announcements provide frameworks to do network analysis grpahs and etc
    - choose one and stick with it.
    - Pyvertix(?) is not too great in notebooks as the viz is interactive
