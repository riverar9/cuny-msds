- Use the notch box plots on the resubmission
    
## My specific graph
- "I have no idea what the correlation is between affiliation and state dependency"
- Is it statistically different
- Matthews Graph showed box-whiskers show the quartiles and let us know if there's a true correlation
- Colors are good because it has the cultural context (red = republican)
- Maybe relabel the Red and Blue to be Republican & Democrat

- For someone who did a box-whisker plot
