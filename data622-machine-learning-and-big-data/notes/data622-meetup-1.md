# DATA 622 lecture 1

- instructor is Joseph Sabelja
- Classes will be recorded and posted online
- Textbooks
    - We have a choice to choose the R path or the Python path
    - The python version focuses in PyTorch (which is pretty much dominant)
    - Books are like $30-40 each, I may as well get it tbh
    - Textbooks versions aren't very different from eachother
- We have some other material that we can grab
    - the first 2 are kinda similar
- In the reading material, there's an indication to pick if you're going on the R or python track
    - these are deliminated with prefixed with R or Python
- Quizzes are simple and quick to incentivize reading and understanding
    - multiple choice
    - you did one in like 5 mins bro
    - they're timed for 30 mins
- We have only one break during thanksgiving
    - so there's a reading and supplemental material
- Phones/Portable devices and cheap GPUs made deep learning possible
    - before that (12 years ago-ish), it wasn't really useful
- Reinforcement Learning - 
    - he brought up how unsupervised and superviesed is stateless
        - IE, every new datapoint doesn't pay attention to the previous ones
    - reinforcement is not stateless, it depends on a sequence of decicions
    - it requires a "reward" to reinforce actions
    - "Model takes actions in the enviornment then received state updates and feedback"
    - This'll be less discussed as it's "its own course"
- unsupervised helps with clustering which'll give us an idea of what we should investigate
- "you usually track anomolies with unsupervised learning and then used supervised learning to predict"
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
    - Defined as "Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments"
    - Narrow AI - a model/AI that is specific to the datatype and problem
