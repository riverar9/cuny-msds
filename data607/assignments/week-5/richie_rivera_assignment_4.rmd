# Overview
In this assignemnt, we will be tidying a dataset containing delay and ontime information for two airlines by city.

The datset resembles the table below:

|| |Los Angeles|Phoenix|San Diego|San Francisco|Seattle|
|------|-------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
|ALASKA|on time|497        |221    |212      |503          |1,841  |
|      |delayed|62         |12     |20       |102          |305    |
|      |       |           |       |         |             |       |
|AM WEST|on time|694        |4,840  |383      |320          |201    |
|      |delayed|117        |415    |65       |129          |61     |


## 1. Setting up the data

Firstly, we will need to have this data available from somewhere in the format above. I decided to use GCP's BigQuery and initalized the table with the below SQL statements:

```{SQL eval = FALSE}
drop table data607.assignment4_data;

CREATE TABLE data607.assignment4_data (
  row_id int64,
  column1 STRING,
  column2 STRING,
  `Los Angeles` INT64,
  `Phoenix` INT64,
  `San Diego` INT64,
  `San Francisco` INT64,
  `Seattle` INT64
);

INSERT INTO data607.assignment4_data 
  (row_id, column1, column2, `Los Angeles`, `Phoenix`, `San Diego`, `San Francisco`, `Seattle`)
VALUES
  (1,'ALASKA', 'on time',494,221,212,503,1841),
  (2,'','delayed',62,12,20,102,305),
  (3,'AM West', 'on time',694,4840,383,320,201),
  (4,'','delayed',117,415,65,129,61);
```

A row_id was necessary as the order of the rows mattered and there was an issue where rows would be ordered by alphabetical order on the first column, disrupting the order.

## 2. Extracting the data from GCP

Since we are using biguery
