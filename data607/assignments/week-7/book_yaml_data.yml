  Description: >-
    Cyrano de Bergerac, verse drama in five acts by Edmond Rostand, performed in
    1897 and published the following year. It was based only nominally on the
    17th-century nobleman of the same name, known for his bold adventures and
    large nose. Set in 17th-century Paris, the action revolves around the
    emotional problems of the noble, swashbuckling Cyrano, who, despite his many
    gifts, feels that no woman can ever love him because he has an enormous
    nose. Secretly in love with the lovely Roxane, Cyrano agrees to help his
    inarticulate rival, Christian, win her heart by allowing him to present
    Cyrano’s love poems, speeches, and letters as his own work. Eventually
    Christian recognizes that Roxane loves him for Cyrano’s qualities, not his
    own, and he asks Cyrano to confess his identity to Roxane; Christian then
    goes off to a battle that proves fatal. Cyrano remains silent about his own
    part in Roxane’s courtship. As he is dying years later, he visits Roxane and
    recites one of the love letters. Roxane realizes that it is Cyrano she loves,
    and he dies content. (Britannica)

    This tells the poignant tale of a Chinese farmer and his family in old
    agrarian China. The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing

    soon meet their own downfall. Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family
