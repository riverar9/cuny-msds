# Question 3.1
#### Consider the GDP information in global_economy. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?


# Question 3.2
For each of the following series, make a graph of the data. If transforming seems appropriate, do so and describe the effect.

#### A. United States GDP from global_economy.
#### B. Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in aus_livestock.
#### C. Victorian Electricity Demand from vic_elec.
#### D. Gas production from aus_production.

# Question 3.3
Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the canadian_gas data?

# Question 3.4
What Box-Cox transformation would you select for your retail data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10)?

# Question 3.5
For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance. Tobacco from aus_production, Economy class passengers between Melbourne and Sydney from ansett, and Pedestrian counts at Southern Cross Station from pedestrian.

# Question 3.7
Consider the last five years of the Gas data from aus_production.

gas <- tail(aus_production, 5*4) |> select(Gas)

#### A. Plot the time series. Can you identify seasonal fluctuations and/or a trend-cycle?
#### B. Use classical_decomposition with type=multiplicative to calculate the trend-cycle and seasonal indices.
#### C. Do the results support the graphical interpretation from part a?
#### D. Compute and plot the seasonally adjusted data.
#### E. Change one observation to be an outlier (e.g., add 300 to one observation), and recompute the seasonally adjusted data. What is the effect of the outlier?
#### F. Does it make any difference if the outlier is near the end rather than in the middle of the time series?

# Question 3.8
Recall your retail time series data (from Exercise 7 in Section 2.10). Decompose the series using X-11. Does it reveal any outliers, or unusual features that you had not noticed previously?

# Question 3.9 
Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show the result of decomposing the number of persons in the civilian labour force in Australia each month from February 1978 to August 1995.

![Figure 3.20: Seasonal component from the decomposition shown in the previous figure.](figure3.20.png)
Figure 3.20: Seasonal component from the decomposition shown in the previous figure.
#### A. Write about 3–5 sentences describing the results of the decomposition. Pay particular attention to the scales of the graphs in making your interpretation.
#### B. Is the recession of 1991/1992 visible in the estimated components?
