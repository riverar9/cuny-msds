I contributed to class by interacting with classmates on Slack, answering questions when I could, and sharing helpful resources like my LinkedIn profile. In lectures, I participated a few times by answering questions. Most of my communication happened within group work, where I helped organize tasks and collaborated with my team to get everything done. Based on my participation and what Iâ€™ve observed from others in class, I believe I should receive a 9/10.
